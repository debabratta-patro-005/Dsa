//
//You are given:
//        1. An integer n, representing the number of product prices in the list.
//        2. A sorted array of n integers, representing the product prices in ascending order.
//        3. An integer targetPrice, which is the price of the product the manager is searching for.
//You need to:
//      Perform a binary search on the sorted list of product prices to find targetPrice.
//      If found, print "Price found at position: x" (1-indexed).
//If not found, print "Price not found".
//Constraints:
//        1 <= n <= 1000
//        1 <= price, targetPrice <= 100,000
